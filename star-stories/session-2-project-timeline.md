## 1. Underestimated Hardware/Firmware Timeline

**Situation:** I was the project owner and system architect for a complex system spanning hardware, firmware, server, client, and cloud components. The project had a customer-facing deadline, so timely delivery was critical.

**Task:** During execution, I realized that we had underestimated the effort required for some hardware and firmware components, which threatened the timeline promised to the customer.

**Action:** I immediately called the team to analyze why certain tasks were taking longer than expected. I realigned resources and reprioritized work to focus on critical path items. I updated the project plan and design documentation to reflect the corrected timelines. I communicated transparently with management and stakeholders about the adjustments.

**Result:** By detecting the underestimation early during execution, we were able to shift the internal project timeline while still meeting the customer-facing deadline. The project was delivered successfully, with the full scope intact.

**Reflection / What I'd do differently:** For future complex projects, I would involve experts early in areas where I lack experience and increase time estimates for uncertain tasks, ensuring potential execution risks are accounted for upfront.
