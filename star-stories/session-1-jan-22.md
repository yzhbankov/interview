## 1. Production Incident

**Situation:** In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer, one evening all systems deployed to a major customer began disconnecting randomly, affecting dozens of production systems.

**Task:** I was responsible for identifying the root cause, minimizing downtime, restoring normal operations, and keeping stakeholders from multiple companies informed.

**Action:** I immediately gathered the on-call team to start the investigation. I systematically checked the systems to localize the problem, starting with centralized services. We analyzed CPU, RAM, and disk usage, scanned logs, and verified network connectivity. I identified that slow ping responses were pointing to a potential cloud provider issue. I contacted the cloud provider and shared all the information with their team. While they investigated, I ensured continuous monitoring and support to keep the customer sites operational.

**Result:** The issue was resolved once the cloud provider fixed a firewall problem on their side. We improved our monitoring system, configured the centralized service for better failure resilience, and have not faced this issue again. Downtime was minimized, and stakeholders remained informed throughout the incident.

## 2. Conflict with Teammate

**Situation:** In a previous project, I was responsible for delivering a feature with high quality. A teammate disagreed with my approach regarding code quality, standardization, and testing. He believed QA should handle all testing, and that coding standards were unnecessary because everyone has personal preferences.

**Task:** My task was to deliver the feature on time with high quality, and resolve our disagreement without affecting team morale.

**Action:** I first listened to his concerns to understand his perspective. I demonstrated tools that made following the coding standards easier and proposed a team discussion to agree on common rules that everyone could follow. For testing, I presented data showing how small issues discovered later by QA could significantly increase workload, emphasizing that investing time upfront was more efficient. Together, we aligned on standards and testing expectations.

**Result:** The feature was delivered with high-quality standards. Our team adopted standardized coding conventions across multiple projects, and test coverage increased, reducing QA workload and post-release bugs. The teammate felt included and the team morale remained positive.

## 3. Technology Stack Decision

**Situation:** When we started a new health monitoring project, the team needed to choose the technology stack. One teammate proposed a new, less widely adopted technology with a small community. I disagreed because I was concerned it could limit support, updates, and long-term maintainability.

**Task:** My task was to influence the team to choose a technology with a larger, active community and proven track record, ensuring better product support and higher quality.

**Action:** I collected data on several candidate technologies and performed a comparative analysis. I presented the results to the team, highlighting the benefits of the technology I recommended versus the proposed option. After discussion, the team acknowledged my concerns but ultimately decided on a hybrid approach. I initially disagreed but fully committed to executing the chosen solution.

**Result:** The hybrid approach was successful. We delivered a product that is still in use today, and the parts built on the more widely supported technology ensured maintainability and reliability, even though some of the newer technologies are not widely adopted yet.
